# NN-PSF
### Part of NSERC-CREATE NTCO training program astronomy research project
Student: Ashley Ferreira
Supervisor: Dr. Wesley Fraser

#### Purpose:
Given cutout of each source in an image along with their respective x and y coordinates, this program calls on a pre-trained machine learnining model that will return a subset of cutouts of sources to use for point spread function creation. It also returns the x and y coordinates of these stars and these can be used to pass into the python module TRIPPy in order to create the desired point spread function.

more into in soon to be attached poster?
-results, what it was trained on

#### Workflow:

production code and final NN

development code for those interested in further work
